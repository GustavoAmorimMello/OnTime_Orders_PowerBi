# OnTime_Orders_PowerBi

* Dashboard created in Power Bi Desktop to analyse orders since the sale confirmation to the delivery to the final client.
* Data extraction and data cleaning using Power Bi tool. 

**In this dashboard I built you will be able to:**

* Analyse the sales steps: Sale confirmation, system integration, payment confirmation, separation process, delivery. 
* Analyse the OnTime percentage of each sale step.
* Analyse which step of sale needs an action and which one is with "Ok" status.
* Analyse in which store there is a higher OnTime period of each step to act on it. The time is linked to the Managers and Directors.
* Analyse in which store there is a low OnTime percentage of each step to act on it. The percentage is linked to the Managers and Directors.
* Analyse with more detailed details each store with the "Drill-through" tool.
